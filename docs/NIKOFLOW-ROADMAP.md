# Nikoflow → oh-my-pi Integration Roadmap

> Written using the **Nikoflow methodology it describes**: Grilling → ADR → PRD →
> Ticketization → TDD → Verification. Every ticket is an atomic vertical slice with
> acceptance criteria, dependencies, and a self-verify step.

## North Star

Make **cheap models (esp. Chinese: DeepSeek / GLM / Qwen / Kimi) produce SOTA-level
output** by wrapping them in **enforced process rails** — a phase-gated methodology
whose gates the model *cannot self-approve* — with the built-in **advisor as a hard QA
gate**. Delivered as a **native `omp` mode**, not a plugin bolted onto someone else's
runtime.

Thesis: a cheap model underperforms less because it is "dumb" and more because it
**skips structure and self-deceives** ("done ✅" on unfinished work). Rails that (a)
force the engineering process and (b) make an independent reviewer's blocker
*binding* raise the *process* to SOTA — at ~1/10 the token cost.

## ⚠️ READ FIRST — Reality check after 6 audit passes

Six adversarial passes each found real, code-verified gaps. **That pattern is the verdict,
not a to-do list.** The full native harness sits on undocumented, single-slot, fast-moving
upstream internals, and its one differentiated idea — the **binding, non-self-approvable
reviewer gate** — is surrounded by ~70% re-derivation of features OMP already ships
(plan-mode ≈ Grilling+human-gate, advisor = reviewer, todo = live plan surface, `modelRoles`
= role routing) plus a growing wall of fragile seams: the architect's *thinking* doesn't
cross the model handoff (H5), the callbacks clobber the advisor (H6), the plan is compacted
away (H4), the reviewer sees it as a one-liner (H3), retry silently demotes the architect
(H2), forced tool-choice degrades silently on the target models. Building the 23-ticket
native mode against a personal fork = high-risk, high-maintenance, mostly re-derivation.

**Honest lean plan (this supersedes the full ticket program below as the recommended path):**
1. **Zero-code arm (b):** `modelRoles` preset (strong `plan` + cheap `default` + strong
   `advisor`) + a nikoflow **prompt/skill** — no harness. Captures most of the thesis TODAY
   and is rebase-proof. This IS the spike's control arm; it may be the whole product.
2. **Corrected TSK-000 spike** (numeric kill thresholds + the 4 arms, §"TSK-000/TSK-012")
   → measure quality AND blended $/task, gate-tag malformation rate, self-approval events.
3. **Only if** the residual gap is caused by self-approval that the prompt layer can't fix →
   build the **minimal binding-gate core (~4 tickets, 1–2 weeks):** phase-state, per-phase
   role-binding (with H2 re-assert), gate-hold-via-follow-up-queue (H6), reviewer-verdict-as-
   tool_result (M1). Everything else — Grilling→ADR→PRD ceremony — stays a **prompt layer**
   (portable, rebase-proof), not native code.
4. Pitch that ~4-ticket **binding-gate primitive** upstream (a maintainer might take a small
   generic capability; they already refused a whole methodology mode).

The ticket program below (TSK-001–023, H1–H9) is the *reference design* if you ever build
the full harness — but the numbers from step 2 decide whether any of it is worth building.

## Fable-5 QA — verdict & mandatory revisions (v2)

Adversarial review audited every Appendix-A ref against the live code. **Verdict: TAKE** —
the crux is buildable without forking the loop, and the refs are honest. Applied
revisions (they change the plan, not just annotate it):

**M1 — The reviewer verdict, not the advisor blocker, is the real gate.** The advisor can
never signal "resolved," and two dedupe layers (`advise-tool.ts:169,185` + `emission-guard`
one-note-per-cycle) physically prevent it from re-emitting an unmet blocker. So a raw
`blocker` latch is **unsound** as a "block until cleared" gate. → **TSK-008 (independent
reviewer whose verdict arrives as a `tool_result` with a unique gate-id) is THE execute/
verify gate; the advisor `blocker` is only a soft steering signal. Dependency inverted:
007 now depends on 008.**

**M2 — Fail-closed, not fail-open.** `waitForCatchup(30000,…)` resolves on a timer
regardless of backlog, and the 3-fail circuit-breaker drops backlog and counts success
(`runtime.ts:356`). "Advisor silent" must NOT read as "approved." The gate requires an
explicit per-turn reviewer ACK (verdict tool_result carrying the current gate-id); absence
of a verdict = gate not passed → escalate to the user after bounded attempts. Never
promote on a timeout.

**M3 — De-risk the thesis FIRST (new TSK-000 spike, before TSK-001).** 1–2 days: existing
advisor + `advisor.syncBacklog` + *prompt-level* (non-enforced) phase rules, cheap primary
(DeepSeek/GLM) vs bare, on ~10 `typescript-edit-benchmark` tasks. Measure pass-rate **and
tokens/time/gate-thrash**. If a cheap primary can't follow even soft rails → do not build
the harness. This is the cheapest falsifier of the whole cheap→SOTA thesis.

**Added/fixed tickets** (fold into Phase 4): **TSK-013** NikoflowState persistence across
save/resume/compaction (a resume mid-Execute must not reset gates); **TSK-014** the
*methodology-mode registry itself* — `modes/` is UI transport, no methodology-mode slot
exists, so "register the mode" is hidden design work; **TSK-015** headless/RPC/print scope
— human gates currently sit on interactive-mode plan-approval, so either add an RPC gate
path or explicitly scope v1 as *interactive-only*; **TSK-016** inject phase rules into the
primary prompt (port `prompts.ts` via `PRIMARY_CONTEXT_CUSTOM_TYPES`); **TSK-017** the
upstream rebase procedure (`origin=can1357/oh-my-pi`, we work in a fork). **Fixes:** TSK-004
uses the Soft-ladder (`setForcedToolChoice` *ends* the turn — wrong mechanism for "don't
yield until artifact"); TSK-012 `blocked-by` = 000–011 (not 009); bounded-attempts→escalate
must be a real PBT invariant (the "no-deadlock" property today covers advisor failure but
NOT a cheap primary that never emits the exact tag).

**TSK-018 — Live plan surface via the native `todo` tool.** oh-my-pi already ships a
phase-grouped, harness-pinned plan surface — `tools/todo.ts` (`{phase, items[]}`, tree-
rendered "Updated Plan") + `modes/components/todo-reminder.ts` (re-pins incomplete items
into the transcript every turn). nikoflow's phases + tickets map onto it 1:1 (the todo
tool is *already* phase-grouped). **Render nikoflow's phase list + the current
`tickets.json` slice into the todo surface** so the user sees a live "Updated Plan □"
(current phase, tickets, statuses, stop condition), kept alive by `todo-reminder`, backed
by the stricter validated ticket-DAG underneath. This is transparency/UX for near-free and
a gap the v1 draft missed. *Acceptance:* an active nikoflow run shows a live phase/ticket
plan via the todo surface that updates as phases/tickets advance. *Blocked-by:* 002/014,
Ticketization (010). *Self-verify:* integration asserts the todo surface reflects
state after a phase/ticket transition.

## Capability rails (v4) — the core design correction

The plan built PROCEDURAL rails (can't skip a phase, can't self-approve) but NOT
CAPABILITY rails. The target Chinese models (DeepSeek/GLM/Qwen/Kimi) are smart
**executors** but weak **architects** — sycophantic in Grilling, unsound in ADR/
Ticketization. A cheap primary driving Grilling→ADR→PRD→Tickets produces a garbage plan
that the rails then faithfully execute. Procedural gates catch "did it self-approve",
not "is the plan any good". The fix is **per-phase model binding**: a STRONG model owns
the judgment phases, the cheap model only executes within its frame.

### ADR-006 — Per-phase role binding (strong architect, cheap executor)
- Each phase in `NikoflowState` carries a `role: ModelRole`; on a phase boundary the mode
  swaps the primary via the **existing** plan-mode model-swap path
  (`resolveRoleModelWithThinking`, `interactive-mode.ts:1956`) — no new mechanism.
- **Binding:** Grilling / ADR / PRD / Ticketization → **`plan`** (strong); TDD/Execute →
  **`default`** (cheap); Verify + reviewer sub-agent (TSK-008) → **`advisor`/`slow`**
  (strong, NEVER `pi/task`). ADR evidence-gathering may use a cheap `task` sub-agent.
- **Capability map** (which phase needs which):

  | Phase | Cheap-CN adequate? | Role |
  |---|---|---|
  | Grilling | No (sycophantic; weak questions cascade) | `plan` |
  | ADR | No (decision); yes (evidence) | `plan` (+ cheap `task` for facts) |
  | PRD | Draft yes, coherence no | `plan`/`slow`, strong approve-rewrite |
  | Ticketization | No (DAG soundness ≠ structural validity) | `plan`; DAG review `advisor` |
  | TDD/Execute | **Yes** (the one phase) | `default` (cheap) |
  | Verify | No (reviewer must not be weaker than executor) | `advisor`/`slow` |

- **Enforcement, not suggestion (code fact):** an unconfigured `plan` role **silently
  falls to the primary** (`model-resolver.ts:875-892`, `plan` has no priority chain). So
  the cheap-preset MUST set `modelRoles.plan` explicitly, and nikoflow **fail-fast on
  activation** if `plan` resolves to the same model as `default` ("architect phases would
  run on the executor — configure a strong `plan` model or confirm"). Without this the
  default install silently defeats the whole thesis.
- **TSK-009 correction:** the preset sets **`modelRoles.default`** (the primary), NOT
  `modelRoles.task` (`task` = sub-agents, `task/agents.ts:54`). Acceptance adds: transcript
  proves Grilling/ADR/PRD/Tickets ran on `plan`, Execute on `default` (via TSK-011).
- **Two presets:** `cheap-exec+strong-arch` (cheap `default` + Opus/GPT `plan`/`advisor`)
  AND `cheap-cn-full` (reasoning-class CN as architect: GLM-5.2 / DeepSeek-v4-pro / Kimi-
  thinking on `plan`+`advisor`, GLM-flash/qwen-coder on `default`). GLM-5.2 + MiniMax-M3
  use `api=anthropic-messages` → honest named tool_choice (see the force caveat below).

### Flexible model configuration — reuse OMP's existing surface, no new system
OMP already ships exactly the flexible, explicit per-role config this needs; nikoflow
must *expose its roles onto it*, not invent a config system:
- **`modelRoles`** (settings, `settings.ts:576`, layered global `~/.omp/agent/settings.json`
  → project `.omp/` → runtime override) — a `role → model-selector` map. The selector
  carries thinking/effort (`model-resolver.ts:922`), e.g. `glm-5.2:high`.
- **`WATCHDOG.yml`** — a roster of named reviewers, each with its own `model`, `tools`
  subset, `instructions` — so architect-review vs security-review vs test-review can each
  pin a different model.
- **Custom models** (`models-config-schema.ts`: `baseUrl`, `thinking`, `effortMap`) — add
  any provider/model.

**Nikoflow config contract:**
- Nikoflow roles map onto OMP roles (user-overridable): `architect → plan`,
  `executor → default`, `reviewer/verifier → advisor` (+ optional named WATCHDOG reviewers
  per gate dimension). A nikoflow settings block may re-point these.
- **Explicit assignment is REQUIRED for the strong roles.** Because an unconfigured `plan`
  silently falls to the primary (`model-resolver.ts:875-892`), nikoflow **fail-fast on
  activation** if `architect`/`reviewer` resolve to the same model as `executor`, or are
  unset. This is the guard that stops a mid-tier model (e.g. MiniMax-M3) doing architecture
  *by accident* — the operator must name it, and the assignment is visible in the run.
- **Authority is the operator's explicit pin, not auto-capability.** A soft advisory may
  warn when the architect model lacks the catalog `reasoning` flag (`ai/types.ts:674`), but
  the harness never auto-promotes/demotes a model — "strong enough" is the operator's call,
  made explicit. MiniMax-M3 architects only if you write it into `architect`.

Example (`.omp/settings.json` / nikoflow block):
```jsonc
{ "modelRoles": {
    "plan":    "deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro:high",  // architect — strong reasoning, explicit
    "default": "glm/glm-flash",                  // executor — cheap
    "advisor": "openai/gpt-5.5"                   // reviewer — strong
} }
// nikoflow refuses to start if `plan` is unset or == `default`.
```

### Handoff & durability holes (v5 — found auditing the per-phase-swap design)

These attack the capability-rail directly at its seams; all verified against source:

- **H1 — Every phase swap RESETS the provider session.** `setModelTemporary` →
  `#setModelWithProviderSessionReset` (`agent-session.ts:8706,11323`) closes the provider
  session on each architect↔executor swap. Consequence: **provider-side prompt cache is
  dropped every phase boundary** → the cheap executor re-ingests the whole plan context
  *uncached* (full input price), and latency spikes. This is a direct, unbudgeted hit to
  the cost thesis (§cost) — minimize swaps (batch same-role phases), and price the
  cache-loss in TSK-012.
- **H2 — Retry-fallback silently replaces a pinned role model.** `retry` machinery
  (`agent-session.ts:13160-13323`) can swap a pinned model to a fallback on error, and
  `retry.fallbackRevertPolicy` can be `never` → **your explicitly-pinned strong `plan`
  architect can silently become a different (possibly weak) model mid-run and stay there.**
  The "explicit pin" guarantee (v4) is NOT durable. Fix: nikoflow sets an explicit
  `fallbackRevertPolicy` for strong roles AND re-verifies `role→model` at the top of every
  architect/reviewer phase, failing the gate if the strong role silently downgraded.
- **H3 — The reviewer sees the plan as one-liners.** Non-whitelisted custom message types
  are collapsed to a single line for the model (`PRIMARY_CONTEXT_CUSTOM_TYPES`,
  `session-history-format.ts:230`). If nikoflow's ADR/PRD/ticket artifacts aren't
  whitelisted, the advisor/reviewer reviews a **summary, not the real plan** → weak/blind
  gate. Fix: register nikoflow's artifact message types in the whitelist so the reviewer
  (and the executor) get them in full.
- **H4 — The architectural plan is NOT protected from compaction (deep-audited).** There is
  **no message pinning** in OMP compaction — any ADR/PRD/ticket-list/unapproved-plan that
  lives only as transcript prose is evicted once behind the compaction cut
  (`docs/compaction.md:81-99`). Default `snapcompact` bitmap-archives the discarded middle
  and drops frames past 80 (`snapcompact.ts:735,414`) — an early plan lands in the lossy
  foveated middle, recoverable only via degraded OCR-read; `context-full` LLM-summarizes it,
  **possibly with a cheap model** (`compactionModel → current → modelRoles.smol → largest-
  ctx`, `agent-session.ts:11672-11709`). So the strong architect's plan can be compacted
  away — or summarized by a *weak* model — before the cheap executor finishes, defeating the
  rail. `mnemopi` does NOT auto-persist it (manual only). **Only three things are durable:**
  (a) **todo phase-state** — rebuilt from raw session entries (`todo.ts:155` +
  `#syncTodoPhasesFromBranch`, re-injected `:7120-7155`), survives compaction; (b) an
  **approved plan written to a `local://<slug>-plan.md` disk file** — re-read + re-injected
  every turn (`approved-plan.ts:110`, proof `agent-session.ts:9700-9706`, issue #1246);
  (c) the compaction summary itself. **Fix (load-bearing):** nikoflow must persist its plan
  in the durable channels, never as transcript prose — **the ticket-DAG into the
  compaction-durable todo-state (this makes TSK-018 a DURABILITY mechanism, not just UX)**
  and the **ADR/PRD into `local://` disk files** via plan-mode's approved-plan machinery so
  they re-inject each turn. Also: never configure a weak `compactionModel`/`modelRoles.smol`
  when plan fidelity matters (a cheap model summarizing the strong architect's plan is
  self-defeating).

**v6 — deeper audit (5 new, verified):**
- **H5 — the architect's THINKING doesn't cross the provider seam.**
  `transform-messages.ts` preserves native thinking only when target wire format == source;
  anthropic **demotes** foreign thinking to plain text or drops it (`anthropic.ts:3461-3491`),
  openai-completions replays reasoning only when compat flags demand (`:1799-1849`). So the
  strong `plan` model's *hidden reasoning* behind ADR/PRD/ticket decisions **never reaches
  the cheap executor**. **Invariant the plan must state:** every architectural decision is
  materialized as a **visible artifact** (tool_result / disk file), never left in thinking;
  the ADR/PRD/Ticket gates pin their *output to disk*, and thinking is non-load-bearing
  across a phase boundary.
- **H6 — `onBeforeYield` CANNOT block, and all four callbacks are single-slot.** It returns
  `void` (`agent.ts:750`) → cannot hold the turn; a gate-hold must **enqueue a follow-up
  message** (`agent-loop.ts:1120`), not "refuse to yield". And `onTurnEnd`/`beforeToolCall`/
  `getToolChoice`/`onBeforeYield` are scalar setters — assigning any **clobbers the
  advisor's existing `onTurnEnd`**, killing the very reviewer the gate depends on. This makes
  TSK-005's Appendix-A mechanism **wrong as written**. Fix: WRAP/CHAIN every existing handler
  (capture prior fn, call it, then gate logic); gate-hold via the follow-up queue.
- **H7 — Grilling has no human to interrogate in autonomous/batch mode.** Grilling is
  iterative human Q&A (plan-approval path); TSK-020's batch profile removes the human. The
  economic thesis (unattended batch) **structurally conflicts with the phase that supplies
  the quality lift** — unattended, the strong model self-answers (inventing the assumptions
  Grilling exists to surface) or no-ops. Fix: autonomous runs replace Grilling with a
  **spec-completeness gate** (strong model writes an assumptions/risks/unknowns doc; a
  reviewer sub-agent scores coverage); state plainly batch gets a weaker spec than interactive.
- **H8 — no executor-capability-failure ladder.** The only retry primitives are
  provider-error fallback and the benchmark's `--max-attempts` — nothing for "cheap executor
  can't get the test green N times." So a genuinely-stuck ticket loops the verify-cap and
  **aborts the whole flow**, or the executor self-deceives green (the exact target failure).
  Fix: per-ticket attempt counter → ladder: retry → re-run Ticketization implementation-notes
  on `plan` → escalate the single ticket's execution to `plan`/`advisor` → human.
- **H9 — cheap-model instruction budget.** Per-turn injections already stack (`todo-reminder`
  + `plan-mode-context` + continuation + goal/ultrathink/workflow notices); nikoflow's phase
  protocol + gate-tag banners add more **every turn**, and an advisor 3-fail clears
  seen-context forcing full re-expansion (`runtime.ts:370`). On weak-instruction cheap
  executors this crowds the ticket → **garbled gate tags → fail-closed → stuck** (UC-H1). Fix:
  minimal per-turn injection, only in the executor's active phase; **measure gate-tag
  malformation rate on cheap models in TSK-000 as a first-class falsifier.**

**Sharpenings of H1-H4/M2:** H1 → batch same-role phases (swap primary 3×: to `plan`, to
`default`, to `advisor` — not per-phase). H2 → re-assert phase→role after the
`retry_fallback_applied` event (`agent-session.ts:13197`), not only at activation. H3 →
whitelist is exactly `{plan-mode-context, plan-mode-reference}` (`session-history-format.ts:230`).
H4 → generalize the compaction matcher to a path-set. M2 → the advisor breaker actively sets
`success=true` after dropping backlog (`runtime.ts:355-371`), so "advisor silent" reads as
pass — the gate must require a positive verdict `tool_result`, treat silence/drop as escalate.

### Design-drift inside Execute (rails don't reach here)
Gates fire at phase boundaries; inside a ticket the cheap executor still decides *how* to
implement, *whether* a test is green-enough, *how* to read an AC. Compress that space:
- The Ticketization gate (on `plan`) emits, per ticket, **implementation notes** (files /
  pattern / helpers), not just AC — shrinking the executor's design latitude to near-zero.
- The TSK-008 reviewer checks not only "AC met" but "**consistent with the ADR/PRD**"
  (anti-drift) — add to TSK-008 acceptance. Both mechanisms already exist; cheap to add.

### Cost shape (the "~1/10" claim, corrected)
~80–90% of tokens are Execute (cheap, many); architecture phases are few but dense.
With a **Western strong architect** (Opus/GPT), blended cost is realistically **~25–40%**
of "SOTA-does-everything", not 1/10 — the strong architect + strong reviewer read
expensive context. The **`cheap-cn-full`** preset (strong architect is *also* a cheap CN
reasoning model) is what keeps blended near **~1/10–1/7**. The headline claim must be
stated as "≈ SOTA quality at X% cost" with X **measured**, not asserted.

### TSK-000 / TSK-012 — measure the right split (4 arms)
Neither current arm isolates the strong-architect's contribution — which, per the owner's
thesis, is where the lift comes from. Required arms:
(a) cheap bare · (b) cheap + rails **all-cheap** (pure procedure effect) · (c) cheap
executor + **strong `plan`/`advisor`** rails (the product) · (d) SOTA bare · opt. (e)
strong-CN architect. Metric = quality **and blended $/solved-task** (tokens are unequally
priced — use catalog cost fields + advisor JSONL). **Falsifiers:** if (b)≈(c) the
"weak-architect" thesis is wrong and strong roles are unneeded (ship a config preset,
build nothing); if (c)≫(b) procedural rails alone don't work and the capability binding is
the product.

### Forced tool_choice degrades SILENTLY on target models (fix TSK-004)
The roadmap expected a throw; the real behavior on `openai-completions`
(DeepSeek/Kimi/Qwen/Zhipu) is **silent degradation** (`providers/openai-completions.ts:
1454`): forced→auto. Worse: `compat/openai.ts:269,444` — DeepSeek-reasoning
`supportsToolChoice=false`; **Kimi forced-tool DISABLES reasoning** exactly on the
ADR/PRD/ticket artifacts that need it. Only GLM-5.2 / MiniMax-M3 (anthropic-messages) force
honestly. → the artifact gate must **validate post-hoc** ("was the artifact tool actually
called + well-formed?"), never trust that the force took; "degrade to escalate" is
insufficient because the failure is silent (nothing to detect but a missing result).

---

## Use-case coverage (v3) — gaps the phase model must answer

Stress-testing the design across real scenarios surfaced 7 gaps. These are DESIGN
questions to resolve in ADR/PRD, plus tickets:

- **UC-A3 — Non-TDD task shapes (refactor / debug / research / docs).** The TDD phase's
  "RED before GREEN" assumes *new* tests; a pure refactor, a debugging session, a research
  task, or a docs change doesn't fit. → **TSK-019 — per-task-type phase profiles**: the
  Grilling phase classifies task shape (feature / refactor / debug / research / docs) and
  selects a phase profile where "Verify" means the appropriate evidence (characterization
  tests for refactor, a reproduction+fix for debug, sources for research), not always
  test-first. Without this the harness only fits "new feature with tests."
- **UC-C2 — Autonomous / headless / batch (the cheap-model-at-scale value).** Human gates
  cannot get a user turn in CI/print/RPC/batch — yet running cheap models *in batch* is the
  whole economic thesis. → **TSK-020 — autonomous gate policy**: a launch-time
  authorization profile where human gates are either (a) pre-authorized at invocation
  (`--autonomous --depth deep --approve prd,tickets`) or (b) replaced by a stronger-model
  reviewer gate; anti-self-approval still holds (a real *reviewer* tool_result, not the
  primary's text). This makes nikoflow usable unattended, not just interactive.
- **UC-D1 — Human override / abort.** Anti-self-approval binds the MODEL, not the human. A
  human must be able to force-advance, skip a phase, or abort — explicitly and audited. →
  **TSK-021 — human override**: `omp nikoflow` accepts an operator override at any gate
  (recorded in the transcript/stats as an override, distinct from a passed gate) plus a
  clean abort that tears down phase state.
- **UC-G1 — Mid-flow model switch.** OMP swaps models on context growth/compaction
  (`contextPromotionTarget`/`compactionModel`). The phase/gate/ticket state must survive the
  swap AND the new model must be re-briefed on the current phase + open gate. →
  **TSK-022 — model-switch survival**: phase-state persists across model switches; on switch,
  re-inject the current phase rules + open-gate context into the new model's prompt.
- **UC-F1 — Parallel tickets.** The OMC nikoflow isolates each ticket in its own git
  worktree for concurrency; this roadmap is silent. Decide explicitly: **v1 = strictly
  serial**; parallel ticket execution (via worktrees / swarm-extension) is a later ticket
  (TSK-023), not v1. Name the cut so it's not an accidental omission.
- **UC-E1 — Reviewer graceful degradation (not deadlock).** Fail-closed (M2) must not mean
  "stuck forever." No reviewer available / API down → after bounded attempts, **escalate to
  the human with the partial work and the reason**, never silent-hang and never auto-pass.
  Fold into TSK-007/008 acceptance.
- **UC-I1 — Composition with plan-mode / swarm.** nikoflow reuses the plan-approval
  machinery; if the user is already in plan-mode, or nikoflow runs inside a swarm worker,
  the two must not collide. → design note in ADR: nikoflow owns the flow; plan-mode's
  approval overlay is *borrowed*, not stacked; swarm workers run nikoflow only if launched
  as the flow owner. Verify no double-gate.

**Also:** UC-A1 (trivial task) — Grilling may over-propose; the tactical tier already exists
but add a "no-gate micro" escape for genuine one-liners so the harness doesn't tax a typo.
UC-B1 (huge task) — the Ticketization gate should cap ticket count / force decomposition
before APPROVED. UC-H1 (cheap model garbles the gate protocol) is TSK-006's bounded-
attempts→escalate invariant (already named in M-fixes).

---

**Verify-before-build checks** (do in TSK-000/001, not after): (a) per-provider — does
DeepSeek/GLM/Qwen/Kimi support hard `tool_choice` forcing? `buildNamedToolChoice` throws
"model does not support forcing a specific tool" on some, so the Soft-ladder's top rung may
be absent — the gate design must degrade to escalate, not hang. (b) Grilling "read-only" by
tool-name does NOT stop `bash echo > file`; either ban bash-writes in Grilling or sandbox.
(c) `onTurnEnd`/`beforeToolCall`/`onBeforeYield` are single-slot last-writer-wins fields and
the session already owns `onTurnEnd` — chain, don't overwrite (R2 was understated).

**Scope reality:** DEEP + full ticket set + PBT + benchmark ≈ **4–8 weeks**, not a "feature."
Minimal thesis-proving core: **TSK-000 spike → 001, 002/014, 003, 005, 006, 008-as-gate**;
PBT/011/012 are the tail.

## 🔥 Phase 1 — Grilling (interrogate before any code)

**Why this, why now.** oh-my-pi already owns its agent loop and ships a strong
per-turn advisor. That is the missing substrate the Claude-Code plugin version of
nikoflow never had (there it rides Stop-hooks — a *reactor* that only gates at turn
boundaries, so the model can self-drive every phase in one turn). Owning the loop lets
gates be enforced at *orchestration* time.

**Why native, not a plugin / not a loop fork.**
- Plugin/hook (rejected): weak enforcement, the self-drive bypass, non-portable.
- Fork the loop (rejected): permanent merge pain against a fast-moving upstream.
- **Native mode via existing callbacks (chosen):** the loop already exposes every hook
  a phase gate needs; `plan-mode` is a working precedent for a human-gated phase.

**The one real gap (the crux).** The advisor's `blocker` severity is still *advisory*
(`guidance="weigh, don't blindly obey"`, `advise-tool.ts`). The primary can self-approve
past it. **Closing that — making a reviewer verdict binding — is the core of nikoflow's
value and the single hardest thing to build here.**

**Risks to carry through every phase.**
- R1 — self-approval: the primary emitting an "approved" tag/text must never advance a
  gate; only a real user turn (human gates) or an independent reviewer tool_result
  (execute/verify gates) may.
- R2 — no loop fork: all enforcement through documented callbacks, phase-state as a
  separate object (mirror `plan-mode/state.ts`).
- R3 — cheap-model tool-calling reliability: some cheap models emit malformed tool
  calls; the `SoftToolRequirement` remind→escalate→force ladder must degrade sanely.
- R4 — upstream mergeability: keep the diff additive; do not rewrite `agent-loop.ts`.
- R5 — advisor flooding / cost: reuse `emission-guard` + severity routing; the hard-gate
  must not turn the advisor into a lockstep bottleneck (bound with `waitForCatchup`).

**Depth tier: DEEP** — architectural change + property-based tests + a benchmark as
evidence.

**GATE (human):** owner confirms the North Star, the "advisor-blocker becomes binding"
crux, and the DEEP tier before ADR.

## 📋 Phase 2 — ADR (architecture decisions)

Record only hard-to-reverse, surprising-without-context, real-trade-off decisions.

### ADR-001 — Nikoflow is a stateful *mode object*, driven through existing loop callbacks
- **Options:** (a) fork `agent-loop.ts`; (b) new mode object + callbacks; (c) implement as an advisor-only construct.
- **Decision:** (b). A `NikoflowState` object (per session, mirror of `packages/coding-agent/src/plan-mode/state.ts`) holds `{phase, depth, gateRequestId, tickets[]}`; the loop is driven, never forked, via the five hooks (Appendix A).
- **Consequences:** additive diff, upstream-mergeable; no control over anything the callbacks don't expose (accept).

### ADR-002 — The advisor is the reviewer/QA rail; add a *binding-gate* layer on top
- **Decision:** reuse `AdvisorRuntime` (`advisor/runtime.ts`) as the reviewer. Add a thin **gate enforcer** that reads `blocker` notes off the advisor channel and refuses phase promotion until cleared. Do NOT re-implement review.
- **Rationale:** the advisor already runs a strong reasoner (`advisor→slow` role), reads hidden reasoning + diffs, is code-throttled (`emission-guard`), and has a failure circuit-breaker. Only its *bindingness* is missing.
- **Consequences:** nikoflow's differentiator (anti-self-approval) is delivered as a small enforcement layer, not a new subsystem.

### ADR-003 — Human gates reuse the plan-approval machinery
- **Decision:** depth/interview/prd/tickets gates capture a real human turn via the plan-review path (`interactive-mode.ts#abortPlanApprovalTurnSilently` + `ClientMode.handlePlanApproval` + `session.prompt`), correlated by a minted `gateRequestId` that rotates on any premature tag (closes R1).
- **Consequences:** no new UI; reuses a proven human-in-the-loop overlay.

### ADR-004 — Cheap-model rails are pure `modelRoles` config, no code change
- **Decision:** ship presets that set `modelRoles.task = <cheap primary>` and `modelRoles.advisor = <strong/specialized rail>` via `WATCHDOG.yml` + settings; rely on the existing provider/catalog layer (DeepSeek/GLM/Qwen/Kimi are first-class, host-quirks auto-detected).
- **Consequences:** "cheap→SOTA" is a config surface + the rails, not a provider rewrite.

### ADR-005 — Phase-legal toolsets enforced at `beforeToolCall`
- **Decision:** each phase declares a legal toolset; `beforeToolCall` blocks illegal tools (Grilling = read-only; TDD = a failing test must exist before impl writes) — mirroring `enforcePlanModeWrite`.

**GATE (human):** owner records/《skips》each ADR.

## 📄 Phase 3 — PRD

**[Developer] can run a phase-gated build that a cheap model cannot fake its way through.**

- **US-1 — Activate.** *Given* a repo, *when* I run `omp nikoflow[:tactical|standard|deep] "<task>"`, *then* the session enters Grilling and cannot touch the working tree until the depth gate is confirmed by me.
- **US-2 — Human gate.** *Given* a human gate is open, *when* the model emits the confirm tag without my reply, *then* it is rejected (request-id rotated) and the phase does not advance.
- **US-3 — Binding reviewer.** *Given* the execute/verify gate, *when* the advisor (or a spawned reviewer sub-agent) emits `blocker`, *then* the phase cannot promote until the blocker is cleared, regardless of what the primary claims.
- **US-4 — Phase-legal tools.** *Given* the Grilling phase, *when* the model attempts a write/edit tool, *then* it is blocked with a reason.
- **US-5 — Cheap rails.** *Given* a cheap-model preset, *when* I run a deep task, *then* the cheap model executes and the strong advisor gates quality, at a fraction of SOTA cost.
- **US-6 — Evidence.** *Given* a completed run, *then* `omp stats` shows the phase transitions, gate outcomes, and reviewer verdicts.

**Test seams (highest, fewest):**
1. `NikoflowState` transition function (pure) — phase machine + gate acceptance/rotation.
2. The gate-enforcer that maps advisor `blocker` → phase-block (pure, fed synthetic advisor notes).
3. `beforeToolCall` phase-legality predicate (pure).
4. Integration: a scripted session that drives Grilling→…→Verify with a mock model + mock advisor, asserting BLOCK→PASS at each gate.

**GATE (human):** owner confirms the seams (`SEAMS_CONFIRMED`).

## 🎫 Phase 4 — Ticketization (atomic, vertical, demoable)

> Each ticket: acceptance criteria · blocked-by · self-verify. IDs stable.

- **TSK-001 — Phase-state object.** `NikoflowState` (`{phase, depth, gateRequestId, tickets}`), a pure transition fn `advance(state, event)`, and mint/rotate for `gateRequestId`. Mirror `plan-mode/state.ts`.
  - *Acceptance:* transitions match the depth's phase list; a tag with a stale request-id is ignored; no request-id → no advance. *Blocked-by:* —. *Self-verify:* unit tests on the transition fn.
- **TSK-002 — Mode wiring & CLI entry.** `omp nikoflow[:tier]` activates the mode; register the mode object; hold state per session. *Acceptance:* activation writes state, sets phase=grilling. *Blocked-by:* 001. *Self-verify:* `omp nikoflow "x"` → state present.
- **TSK-003 — Phase-legal toolset via `beforeToolCall`.** Per-phase legal toolset; block illegal tools with a reason. *Acceptance:* Grilling blocks edit/write; TDD blocks impl-write before a failing test exists. *Blocked-by:* 001. *Self-verify:* unit on the predicate + a blocked tool call in integration.
- **TSK-004 — Forced artifacts via `SoftToolRequirement`.** Use `ToolChoiceQueue`/`setForcedToolChoice` to require the ADR/PRD/tickets artifact before advancing. *Acceptance:* the loop will not yield the phase until the artifact tool is called. *Blocked-by:* 001. *Self-verify:* integration with a mock model.
- **TSK-005 — Gate enforcement via `onBeforeYield`.** Refuse to yield until the current phase's gate predicate passes. *Acceptance:* a completed turn with an unmet gate re-prompts instead of stopping. *Blocked-by:* 001, 003. *Self-verify:* integration BLOCK case.
- **TSK-006 — Human gates via plan-approval.** depth/interview/prd/tickets require a real user turn after mint; premature tag rotates the id (R1). *Acceptance:* self-confirm rejected; user reply advances. *Blocked-by:* 005. *Self-verify:* integration: no-reply→blocked, reply→pass.
- **TSK-007 — Binding advisor gate.** Read advisor `blocker` off its channel; execute/verify cannot promote while an unresolved blocker exists. Bound with `waitForCatchup` (no lockstep). *Acceptance:* synthetic `blocker` blocks promotion; cleared → passes; advisor down (circuit-breaker) → escalate to user, never deadlock. *Blocked-by:* 005. *Self-verify:* unit on the enforcer + integration.
- **TSK-008 — Reviewer sub-agent at gates.** Spawn an independent reviewer (`TaskTool`/child `Agent`) whose tool_result carries the verdict; the primary's own text never satisfies the gate (R1). *Acceptance:* gate accepts only the sub-agent's result. *Blocked-by:* 007. *Self-verify:* integration.
- **TSK-009 — Per-role cheap-model rails preset.** `WATCHDOG.yml` + `modelRoles` presets: cheap `task` primary + strong `advisor`. *Acceptance:* `omp nikoflow --preset cheap-cn` routes roles correctly; run completes. *Blocked-by:* 002. *Self-verify:* config test + a live smoke on DeepSeek/GLM.
- **TSK-010 — Depth tiers & phase lists.** tactical (Grilling→Execute→Verify) / standard (+ADR+PRD+Tickets) / deep (+PBT+evidence). *Blocked-by:* 001. *Self-verify:* unit on phase materialization.
- **TSK-011 — Evidence surface.** phase transitions + gate outcomes + reviewer verdicts into `omp stats` / advisor JSONL. *Blocked-by:* 005–008. *Self-verify:* stats shows a run.
- **TSK-012 — Benchmark: cheap+rails vs SOTA-bare.** Run `terminal-bench` / `typescript-edit-benchmark` with (a) cheap model bare, (b) cheap model + nikoflow rails, (c) SOTA bare. *Acceptance:* reproducible numbers; (b) closes most of the (a)→(c) gap. *Blocked-by:* 009. *Self-verify:* committed benchmark report.

**GATE (human):** owner iterates until the breakdown is `APPROVED`.

## 🔴🟢 Phase 5 — TDD strategy (test-first per ticket)

- **RED before GREEN** at the pre-agreed seams (§PRD). One vertical slice at a time.
- Pure cores first (`NikoflowState.advance`, the gate enforcer, the phase-legality
  predicate) — deterministic, fast, property-testable.
- **Property-based tests (deep tier):** invariants —
  - *no-self-approve*: for any sequence of primary-emitted tags without an interleaved user turn / reviewer result, the phase never advances;
  - *rotation soundness*: a rotated request-id is never re-accepted;
  - *no-deadlock*: for any advisor failure/timeout, the flow escalates within bounded steps.
- Integration harness: a scripted `AgentSession` with a **mock model** + **mock advisor**
  asserting the BLOCK→PASS transition at every gate (mirrors the plan-approval tests).
- Reuse the repo's existing vitest/bun test setup; keep each ticket's slice green before
  the next.

---

## ✅ Phase 6 — Verification

- **Per ticket:** its own tests green; `bun build`/typecheck clean; an independent
  reviewer (the advisor itself, dogfooded) scores the slice.
- **Feature-level DoD:**
  1. All property invariants hold (no-self-approve, rotation, no-deadlock).
  2. Integration harness shows BLOCK→PASS at each gate end-to-end.
  3. **Live dogfood:** run `omp nikoflow:tactical "fix a typo"` on a real repo; observe a
     real human gate blocking until reply, and a binding reviewer verdict — quoted from
     the transcript.
  4. **The benchmark (TSK-012):** cheap+rails materially closes the gap to SOTA-bare —
     the headline evidence for the whole thesis.
- **Escalation:** anything touching the anti-self-approval enforcement (TSK-006/007/008)
  is design-then-STOP — owner sign-off before it ships.

watchdog breadcrumb, not phases; `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/` is UI transport, not
methodology phases.

## Appendix B — What ports directly from the existing nikoflow (TS)

The Claude-Code nikoflow's pure cores are reusable almost verbatim (already TS):
`loop.ts` phase machine + request-id mint/rotate, `gates.ts` gate detection,
`tickets.ts` DAG/validation, `prompts.ts` phase prompts, role routing. They plug into
the mode object (TSK-001) and the callbacks above; the *enforcement wiring* is the new,
OMP-specific work.
